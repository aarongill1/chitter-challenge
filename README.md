## Chitter Project ##

App is a Twitter clone that will allow users to post messages (peeps).

App allows sign-in from a user, whom must be signed up and in the database before they can do so. Instructions for setting up tables are in the migrations folder.

Once logged in, a user can post peeps and see a list of all peeps created.

Future changes will involve the ability to see peeps posted by the user and a separate thread of all peeps.

Currently no formatting/CSS, so looks incredibly dull - future updates will make it look 'prettier'

I took an outside/in approach - completing user stories via a TDD method to get 'things' working before trying to improve. Needs work but basic functionality works.
